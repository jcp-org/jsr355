## Changes to the Process Document and the Standing Rules since Public Review

These documents are very similar to the versions published for Public Review. Here is a list of the changes made since then:

1) Added language confirming that the changes relating to a merged EC will apply to all existing JSRs when/if they next go for ballot. (See [JSR355-14: Modify Process Document to state that the merged EC provisions apply to all previous JSRs](https://github.com/jcp-org/jsr355/issues/11).)

2) Merged changes from version 2.1 of the Standing Rules. (See [Incorporate changes made in version 2.1 of the Standing Rules](https://github.com/jcp-org/jsr355/issues/12).)

3) Minor grammatical changes to the Standing Rules (not affecting the meaning of the document.)

Note that the redline versions of the documents show all changes made since the previous version.

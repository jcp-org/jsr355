## **Agenda**

These meetings focused on the EC merge. Since the JSR has not yet been filed we met as an informal Working Group rather than as an official sub-committee of the Expert Group (which does not yet exist.) None of the decisions made by this group are binding, but the preliminary discussions were intended to prepare the way for the work of the formal Expert Group.

## Minutes

During the December 6 meeting Patrick presented a summary of various options for the number of members the merged EC should have, and for the way in which we would make the reduction (see [presentation](/files/Original%20source%20materials/EC-merge.pdf).). Discussion in this meeting focused on the number of members the merged EC should have. The group reached a broad consensus that 25 members would be a suitable compromise. This will be relatively easy to achieve with minimal disruption, and yet will result in a group that is more manageable than the full complement of 32 members. In order to reduce to 25 we will need to eliminate Oracle's second permanent seat, four ratified seats (of which one would be IBM's second seat) and two elected seats.

At the November f2f meeting Patrick agreed to poll those members whose term ends in 2013 to ask them whether they would be willing to voluntarily relinquish their seats in 2012, enabling the entire reduction in membership to take place in that year. He announced the results of this poll at the December 20 Working Group meeting. They were as follows:

*   Yes (willing to relinquish in 2012)
    *   Aplix
    *   Eclipse
    *   RedHat
    *   SouJava
*   No (not willing to relinquish in 2012)
    *   Goldman Sachs
    *   Google
    *   RIM
    *   TOTVS
*   No response
    *   Stefano Andreani
    *   Samsung

These responses effectively ruled out _Option 1_ (making the entire reduction in 2012.) After a brief discussion of the complexities involved in _Option 2_ (making the reduction in two phases, in 2012 and 2013) a consensus quickly emerged that _Option 1a_ (making no reduction in 2012, but having everyone run for re-election and taking the entire reduction in 2013) would be preferable due to its simplicity.

Members also agreed that it would be advantageous to merge the ECs in 2012, since this would send the message that we are making changes and that "Java is one platform." At that point the size of the merged EC could be reduced to 30 by eliminating the second Oracle and IBM seats.

We then discussed whether members of the merged EC should serve two-year or three-year terms. A majority of those expressing an opionion opted for two-year terms.

## The current proposal

As a result of these preliminary discussions the following proposal will form the starting-point of the Expert Group's deliberations after the JSR is filed (note that the JSR will not go into this level of detail - it will simply state the goals of merging the ECs and reducing the number of members, leaving the details of how to do this up to the EG.)

*   The 2012 annual elections will be held as usual (all seats that expire in 2012 will be up for re-election) but candidates will be informed that they will serve only a one-year term if elected.
*   Immediately after the October 2012 elections the two ECs will be merged. Oracle and IBM will each give up their second seat, resulting in a merged EC of 30 members.
    *   Note that changes introduced in JSR 348 specify that members who miss two meetings in a row lose their vote, and their seat is excluded from quorum calculations. It is therefore likely that between October 2012 and October 2013 the effective size of the merged EC (counting only voting members) will be approximately 27 members.
*   In the October 2013 elections three ratified and two elected seats will be eliminated. All remaining seats will be up for re-election.
*   After 2013 we will reset to a two-year election cycle.
*   Whether members who are elected in 2013 will serve an initial term of one or two years will be determined by ranking them (within the group of ratified or elected members) by the number of votes they received. The 50% of members in each group who receive the most votes will serve an initial two-year term while the others will serve an initial one-year term.
*   All members elected in 2014 and subsequently will serve a two-year term.

Note that these are simply preliminary proposals, and are subject to change by the Expert Group once it is formed.

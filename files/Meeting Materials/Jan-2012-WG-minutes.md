## Minutes

### The EC-merge JSR

Patrick reviewed the current state of the plans for the [EC-merge JSR](http://java.net/projects/jsr355/downloads/download/Meeting%20Materials/EC-merge-January.pdf).  

During discussion of other changes that might be made in this JSR he noted that the language in the Process Document and EC Standing Rules concerning the need for a super-majority for JSRs that define new platforms or modify the Java language is potentially ambiguous (should abstentions be counted or not?) Most members agreed that the existing language explicitly excludes abstentions (so that the "yes" votes must amount to two-thirds of the "yes" and "no" votes cast) but Patrick suggested that it might be helpful to modify the Standing Rules to make this explicit.  

It was suggested that we might want to raise the minimum number of "yes" votes for JSR approval from five (approximately one-third of the number of members on each individual EC) to 8 for the merged EC. No agreement was reached but we did agree to discuss this further.  

Members then proceeded to discuss the main proposals outlined in the presentation.  

On the proposal for a two-year as opposed to a three-year election cycle there did not seem to be a strong consensus. This will require further discussion.  

There was much discussion of whether 25 was the appropriate number of members for the merged EC - some people suggesting that if circumstances change we might not want to reduce the numbers at all. After considering the possibility of waiting until 2013 to choose the number we agreed to go ahead and complete the JSR with a target of 25, but to note that if circumstances change we could do a Maintenance Release in mid-2013 (before the election that would reduce the numbers) to modify this.  

Werner Keil asked whether we had the option in 2012 not to fill a ratified seat, but rather to wait until 2013\. Patrick responded that we did include this provision in JSR 348.  

We discussed the possibility of changing the date of the annual elections in order to permit new members to meet others face-to-face as soon as possible afterwards (either at JavaOne or at an EC f2f meeting.) This did not seem practical, since the dates for JavaOne may change from year to year, and it would not be reasonable to expect election candidates who could not be sure they would win to commit to travel - possibly internationally - only a month after the election.  

We reviewed the [proposed text of the JSR](http://java.net/projects/jsr355/downloads/download/Meeting%20Materials/EC-merge-JSR.md) and some minor revisions were suggested. Patrick agreed to make the suggested changes and then circulate the revised proposal for final EC approval. He said that he planned to file the JSR during the week ending January 20.

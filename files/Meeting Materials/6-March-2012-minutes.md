He then briefly reviewed the draft versions of the new Process Document [(redline](/files/Meeting%20Materials/JCP-2.9-06MAR2012-redline.pdf), [clean](/files/Meeting%20Materials/JCP-2.9-06MAR2012-clean.pdf)) and Standing Rules ([redline](/files/Meeting%20Materials/JCP-EC-Standing-Rules-06MAR2012-redline.pdf), [clean](/files/Meeting%20Materials/JCP-EC-Standing-Rules-06MAR2012-clean.pdf).) He encouraged members to review these documents offline, and to report errors and suggested changes by logging bugs in the undefined. He said that he planned to post the documents - including any additional changes suggested by members - as the Early Draft Review in a couple of weeks.

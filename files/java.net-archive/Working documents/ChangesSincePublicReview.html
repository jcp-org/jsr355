<h2>Changes to the Process Document and the Standing Rules since Public Review</h2>
<p>These documents are very similar to the versions published for Public Review. 
  Here is a list of the changes made since then:</p>
<p>1) Added language confirming that the changes relating to a merged EC will 
  apply to all existing JSRs when/if they next go for ballot. (See <a href="http://java.net/jira/browse/JSR355-14">JSR355-14: 
  Modify Process Document to state that the merged EC provisions apply to all 
  previous JSRs</a>.)</p>
<p>2) Merged changes from version 2.1 of the Standing Rules. (See <a href="http://java.net/jira/browse/JSR355-15">Incorporate 
  changes made in version 2.1 of the Standing Rules</a>.)</p>
<p>3) Minor grammatical changes to the Standing Rules (not affecting the meaning 
  of the document.)</p>
<p>Note that the redline versions of the documents show all changes made since 
  the previous version.</p>

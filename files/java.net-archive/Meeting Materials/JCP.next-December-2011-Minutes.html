<h2><strong>Agenda</strong></h2>
<p>These meetings focused on the EC merge. Since the JSR has not yet been
    filed we met as an informal Working Group rather than as an official sub-committee
    of the Expert Group (which does not yet exist.) None of the decisions made
    by this group are binding, but the preliminary discussions were intended
    to prepare the way for the work of the formal Expert Group. </p>
<h2>Minutes</h2>
<p>During the December 6 meeting Patrick presented a summary of various options
  for the number of members the merged EC should have, and for the way in which
    we would make the reduction (see <a href="http://java.net/projects/jsr355/downloads/download/Original%20source%20materials/EC-merge.pdf">presentation</a>.).
    Discussion in this meeting focused on the number of members the merged EC
    should have. The group reached a broad consensus that 25 members would be
    a suitable compromise. This will be relatively easy to achieve with minimal
    disruption, and yet will result in a group that is more manageable than the
    full complement of 32 members. In order to reduce to 25 we will need to eliminate
    Oracle's second permanent seat, four ratified seats (of which one would be
    IBM's second seat) and two elected seats.</p>
<p>At the November f2f meeting Patrick agreed to poll those members whose
    term ends in 2013 to ask them whether they would be willing to voluntarily
    relinquish their seats in 2012, enabling the entire reduction in membership
    to take place in that year. He announced the results of this poll at the
    December 20 Working Group meeting. They were as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Yes
    (willing to relinquish in 2012)
    <ul>
      <li>Aplix </li>
      <li>Eclipse</li>
      <li> RedHat</li>
      <li>SouJava</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>No (not willing to relinquish in 2012)
      <ul>
        <li>Goldman Sachs</li>
        <li>Google</li>
        <li>RIM</li>
        <li>TOTVS</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>No response
    <ul>
      <li>Stefano Andreani</li>
      <li>Samsung</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>These responses effectively ruled out <em>Option 1</em> (making the entire
    reduction in 2012.) After a brief discussion of the complexities involved
    in <em>Option 2</em> (making the reduction in two phases, in 2012 and 2013)
    a consensus quickly emerged that <em>Option 1a</em> (making no reduction
    in 2012, but having everyone run for re-election and taking the entire reduction
    in 2013) would be preferable due to its simplicity. </p>
<p>Members also agreed that
  it would be advantageous to merge the ECs in 2012, since this would send
  the message that we are making changes and that &quot;Java is one platform.&quot; At
  that point the size of the merged EC could be reduced to 30 by eliminating
  the second Oracle and IBM seats.</p>
<p>We then discussed whether members of the merged EC should serve two-year
  or three-year terms. A majority of those expressing an opionion opted for
  two-year terms.</p>
<h2>The current proposal </h2>
<p>As a result of these preliminary discussions the following proposal will
    form the starting-point of the Expert Group's deliberations after the JSR
    is filed (note that the JSR will not go into this level of detail - it will
    simply state the goals of merging the ECs and reducing the number of members,
    leaving the details of how to do this up to the EG.)</p>
<ul>
  <li>The 2012 annual elections will be held as usual (all seats that expire
    in 2012 will be up for re-election) but candidates will be informed that
    they will serve only a one-year term if elected. </li>
  <li>Immediately after the October 2012 elections the two ECs will be merged.
    Oracle and IBM will each give up their second seat, resulting in a merged
    EC of 30 members.
    <ul>
      <li>Note that changes introduced in JSR 348 specify that members who miss
        two meetings in a row lose their vote, and their seat is excluded from
        quorum calculations. It is therefore likely that between October 2012
        and October 2013 the effective size of the merged EC (counting only voting
        members) will be approximately 27 members. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In the October 2013 elections three ratified and two elected seats will
    be eliminated. All remaining seats will be up for re-election. </li>
  <li>After 2013 we will reset to a two-year election cycle. </li>
  <li>Whether members who are elected in 2013  will serve an initial term
    of one or two years will be determined by ranking them (within the group
    of ratified or elected members) by the number of votes they received. The
    50% of members in each group who receive the most votes will serve an initial
    two-year term while the others will serve an initial one-year term. </li>
  <li>All members elected in 2014 and subsequently will serve a two-year term.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these are simply preliminary proposals, and are subject to change
  by the Expert Group once it is formed. </p>
